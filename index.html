        What is it like to be a Jellyfish?
        <br/>
        Jellyfish are one of the longest prospering animals on this planet that have existed for eons. They have been
        co-existing in the earth ecosystems among us humans, further back among dinosaurs, and even further beyond 500
        million years ago. Jellyfish are wondrous animals. In fact, the world's most venomous animal is a jellyfish, the
        Australian Deadly Box Jellyfish (Chironex fleckeri). The largest invertebrate is a jellyfish, the Black Sea
        Nettle (Chrysaora achlyos). Its rival, the North Atlantic (Chrysara achlyos) can reach 3 meters across the body
        and the tentacles can reach up to 30 meters. The world's first known true biological immortality is a jellyfish,
        the Immortal Jellyfish (Turritopsis dohrnii).
        Jellyfish are squishy aquatic creatures, some drifting and some transparent, that span different invertebrate
        groups. Some belong under the same category as corals, sea anemones, and sea fondus; others belong to the
        lineage that ultimately gave rise to us humans, and one even has an elementary brain and heart.
        Like all animals, jellyfish must hunt for food, reproduce, move around, and protect themselves from predators.
        They do it all without brains, bones, or blood.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Ocean
        <br/>
        Jellyfish are found from pole to pole, from coast to the depth.
        The ocean can be partitioned by horizontal zones and vertical zones. The horizontal zones begin at the coast,
        where the land and water overlap. Only the toughest creatures usually live in the shallow zone due to the
        temperature, salinity, and wet/dry and motion pressures of the tides. Jellyfish that get stranded in this zone
        by drifting past the sub-tidal zones can barely survive for they are already too overheated and dehydrated.
        Vertical ocean zones are water columns which extend vertically from the surface to the bottom, called the
        pelagic realm. Those who drift on the epipelagic zone (from surface to 200 meters down), are referred to as
        planktonic (from planktos, Greek for “drifter”) whereas those that swim through a current are called nektonic.
        Tuna and swordfish are examples of nektons, and most jellyfish are plankton.
        Within the ocean's horizontal and vertical zones are plenty of jellyfish habitats, even at the surface of the
        water. The neuston zone is the top few inches of the ocean, where the surface acts as the boundary with
        planktonic organisms below it. The pleuston zone is right at the air-water interface. Here some organisms live
        above, others live by clinging to the underside of the air, and most have body parts in both regions. Some
        Jellyfish species live in freshwater habitats such as lakes and reservoirs.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Jellyfish Anatomy
        <br/>
        Jellyfish is an unorthodox group of organisms from three evolutionary lineages - the medusozoa, the ctenophores,
        and the sales.
        All jellyfish have a jelly-like body, abilities to catch food, digest it, and push out waste, abilities to
        defend themselves from predators, abilities to reproduce, and abilities to move around. These basic survival
        abilities vary by species.
        Most jellyfish are pelagic, meaning they inhabit in the water column rather than on the seafloor. They are
        planktonic, meaning that they mostly drift and are incapable of resisting against currents. Their bodies are
        gelatinous, which provides buoyancy. And most are transparent, which is speculated to be a defense feature.
        While most jellyfish are planktonic, benthic jellyfish permanently dwell on the seafloor in their fully grown
        adult sexual forms. In the medusae, the benthic forms are trumpet-shaped organisms called stauromedusae. They
        attach to rocks or algae with adhesive glands at their foot like sea anemones and coral polyps. In the
        ctenophores, the benthic forms are flatworm-like creatures known as platyctenes. Most of the stauromedusae and
        platyctenes cannot swim but have free-floating parts. Although they neither look like conventional jellyfish nor
        drift, they are still considered jellyfish because of shared lineage.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Sensory Structures
        <br/>
        The most reliant sensory structure of jellyfish are first, the nervous system, which controls their pulsations
        and sends signals around the body.
        Second, the balance structures, called statocysts, help them maintain their orientation. The light sensing
        structures inform their surrounding area. The statocysts is analogous to the human inner ears, located along the
        rim of the bell between the tentacles. Each statocyst consists of small granules, in which its movements
        activate different nerves, informing the jellyfish's orientation.
        Third, a few jellyfish species can sense vibrations and color, and even slight temperature or chemical changes.
        Many hydrozoan medusae also have red, black, or brown ocelli, typically found at the base of tentacles, that are
        light-sensitive structures. They are not equivalent to the human sight but can tell light from dark.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Nematocysts: Stinging Cells
        <br/>
        Stinging cells, called the nematocysts is a characteristic trait found in all cnidarians, used for both hunting
        and defense. It is a keratinized capsule with a harpoon coiled up inside, a trapdoor, and hair trigger at one
        end. The hair trigger allows the harpoons to discharge with even slight physical stimulus. The venom discharges
        at an explosive force of 40,000 Gs, rated one of the fastest biological processes. This trait is what makes
        jellyfish feel sticky. Fun fact: nematocysts can only be used a single time.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Colloblasts: Sticky Cells
        <br/>
        Whereas a nematocyst is dangerous venom injected into the prey, a colloblast is a sweet lure that entangles
        prey. Colloblasts contain venom but they are used exclusively for food capture and not for defense.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Locomotion Structures
        <br/>
        Although most jellyfish including the larger ones are considered planktons, they have the ability to change
        direction, swim up and down and in few cases swim against currents.
        The most common locomotion is the pulsation swimming of medusae, siphonophores, and salp. Medusae have
        sophisticated muscles that contract and expand the bell using only half as much energy as any other organism
        would for the same motion. When contracting, the water in the bell fires out through an opening narrowed by a
        thin layer of tissue called velum or velarium, creating a push. When expanding back out, the counterstroke
        occurs through the bell's muscle memory, resulting in no energy usage. This makes their locomotion one of the
        most energy efficient locomotions discovered.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Buoyancy Structures
        <br/>
        While jellyfish may regulate their buoyancy by pulsation swimming or by adjusting posture, it is more often
        accomplished through their body structures. These include mesoglea (the jelly), gas-filled floats, spikes, and
        other drag-producing appendages.
        In jellyfish, the area between the ectoderm (outer skin) and endoderm (inner skin) is usually filled with jelly.
        The deficiency of a mesoderm (middle skin) is why cnidarians do not have a brain, which normally develops from
        the mesodermal tissues.
        Mesoglea consists of a collagen matrix comprising 96% of seawater, which makes jellyfish neither fundamentally
        buoyant nor substantial, but just about the same density as seawater. The other 4% are their skins and organs,
        which allows them to conserve much energy to remain positioning in water.
        <br/>
        Reproductive Structures
        <br/>
        All jellyfish have female or male reproductive structures - ovaries or testes - which produce eggs or sperm,
        respectively. Some have both. Among different jellyfish groups the locations and forms of the gonads vary. Some
        types of jellyfish can easily be sexed by its form.
        Hydrozoan medusae's gonads are composed of sex cells that ripen in particular areas, usually epidermal folds
        located on the undersurface of the body wall. In species in which the stomach projects downwards, the gonads are
        usually located along the sides of the stomach wall.
        Typically, the eggs and sperm are just shed into the water. A few hydromedusae brood their fertilized eggs and
        the developing larvae until they are ready to swim independently.
        <br/>
        Digestion Structures
        <br/>
        The digestive process is divided into 3 phases: ingestion of whole or parts of other organisms, both animals and
        plants, digestion of nutrients processed in the stomach then distributed through the radical canals, and then
        excretion of waste, typically pushed back out through the mouth again. Jellyfish have an array of structures
        used for acquiring food, the most common being the tentacles. The structure that bears the mouth is called a
        manubrium, particularly when it hangs down into the bell; in some species it's very short, or even just a simple
        hole. The stomach, called a coelenteron, is an open cavity in the body.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Bioluminescence
        <br/>
        Some creatures are bioluminescent or produce light, such as fireflies, glowworms, squids, and jellyfish.
        Jellyfish typically use bioluminescence to startle predators. In some species it occurs as a glow.
        Clapper Jellies (ocyropsis) are an example of bioluminescent jellyfish, producing their own light. The light is
        bright blue-green that flashes along the comb rows. This feature is speculated to startle potential predators,
        and to avoid parasites.
        On the other hand, the Santa's Hat Jellyfish (periphylla) twinkles. Tiny light pins flash on and off, which
        creates the twinkling effects. This feature is speculated as a method of camouflage, deceiving the animal's true
        size or shape. Periphylla employs another type of camouflage as well. While a flash of light startles some
        creatures, some preys may be attracted to it.
        Periphylla has an opaque red stomach, and this effectively protects itself from prey in the stomach that could
        be startled then struggle from the twinkle effect. In periphylla's natural habitat - cold, deep, dark, and still
        - its stomach looks black, making the stomach virtually disappear.
