                        Jellyfish are squishy aquatic creatures, some drifting and some transparent, that span
                        different
                        invertebrate groups.
                        Some belong under the same category as corals, sea anemones, and sea fondus; others belong
                        to
                        the
                        lineage that ultimately
                        gave rise to us humans, and one even has an elementary brain and heart. Like all animals,
                        jellyfish
                        must
                        hunt for food,
                        reproduce, move around, and protect themselves from predators. They do it all without
                        brains,
                        bones,
                        or
                        blood.
